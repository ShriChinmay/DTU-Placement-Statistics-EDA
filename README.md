# DTU-Placement-Statistics-EDA
Conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on 1100+ DTU student placement records to uncover trends between CGPA, Branch, Role, and CTC.
---
An in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of **1100+ placement records** from **Delhi Technological University (DTU)**, aimed at uncovering meaningful relationships between **academic performance, branch, job roles, and compensation (CTC)**.

---

## Problem Statement

Placements are influenced by multiple factors such as CGPA, branch, job role, and company compensation structure.  
This project explores questions like:

- How does **CGPA impact CTC**?
- Do certain **branches consistently secure better roles**?
- Which **roles offer higher salary distributions**?
- What hidden trends exist in DTU placement outcomes?

---

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records:** 1100+ student placement entries  
- **Key Features:**
  - CGPA
  - Branch
  - Job Role
  - Company
  - CTC (Salary)

The dataset was cleaned and validated before analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Analysis Performed

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Standardized categorical features  
- Removed analytically unjustified outliers  

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- CGPA vs CTC correlation analysis  
- Branch-wise placement and role distribution  
- Role vs salary comparison  
- Salary (CTC) distribution and skewness analysis  

### Visualization
- Scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and violin plots  
- Branch and role-wise comparative visualizations  
- Clean, readable, publication-quality plots  

---

## Key Insights

- CGPA shows a **positive but non-linear relationship** with CTC  
- Certain branches consistently secure **higher-paying roles**  
- In several cases, **job role impacts salary more than branch**  
- High CTC offers are **right-skewed and not evenly distributed**

---

## Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook containing complete EDA workflow  
- 11-page detailed analysis report  
- 3-page summary highlighting major findings  

---

## How to Run
git clone https://github.com/ShriChinmay/dtu-placement-statistics-eda.git
cd dtu-placement-eda
jupyter notebook
Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Outcome

- Identified key patterns influencing placement success
- Provided data-driven insights into salary distribution
- Built a strong real-world EDA project suitable for ML and analytics roles
